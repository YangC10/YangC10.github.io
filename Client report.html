        <h4>Intro</h4>
        <p>The client reporting system at Studyportals helps the organisation and its clients (universities) monitor the
            performance of clients' campaigns. However, as the amount of client campaigns is increasing, the
            legacy system is
            having difficulty handling the amount of data and started to have performance issues. In year 2019, the
            organisation started
            a series of efforts aiming to upgrade the current legecy system and provide better data insights for our
            clients. One of such effort is to rebuild the current client reporting system.

        <h4>Team</h4>
        <p> 1 product manager, 1 designer (me), development team</p>

        <h4>Context & problem</h4>
        <p>As part of the rebuild effort, we thought it's a good opportunity to redesign the outdated interface and
            improve the user experience. As the UX designer on the team, I was responsible for leading the interface
            redesign efforts.</p>




        <h4>Process</h4>
        <div class="process">
            <h4>Examine the current experience</h4>

            <p>The screenshot below shows how the old reporting interface looks like - you will probably recognise some
                of the characteristics in
                products built from 10 years ago: colourful & prominent infographics, default browser UIs,
                considerate-yet-lengthy explanations of the terms, complex tables....</p>
            <img src="images/Reporting/Old reports.jpg" alt="design thinking" class="img-fluid" width="800">
            <p>To decide on a strategy of the redesign, I decided to run some user research to get a bit more insight on
                the current reports. I sent out a survey to around 250 clients asking about their opinions on different
                aspects of the current reports, including content, usability and aesthetics. Based on the results of the
                survey, I identified the major places for improvements. Together with the product owner and the team, we
                prioritised them and planned them into user stories.

                Screenshot of the survey results:</p>

            <h4>Define redesign strategy</h4>
            <p>Based on the evaluation and resutls from the survey, I defined the goals of the redesign:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Keep what works but improve the usability & readability of the current content;</li>
                <li> Improving the presentation of the info graphics, makes it easier to understand;</li>
                <li> Improving the aesthetics of the reports to make it more appealing and more inline with the brand
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>These strategies have been translated into the following UI improvements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Leverage proper navigation element to support user with easily accessing different sections on the
                    page;</li>
                <li> Display contents with the correct hireacy;</li>
                <li>Simplify the information presented and provide more controls for users to fine-tune the results;
                </li>
                <li> Re-visit the info graphics used today and use appropriate info graphics based on the type of
                    contents;</li>

                <li> Use styles and components from Studyportals' design system;
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>UI design</h4>

            <h4>Customer adoption and feedback</h4>
            <p>We included a in-app survey when we launched the beta version of redesigned reporting system to gather
                feedback from our clients. The reactions from the initial batch of the customers were positive:
                <b>75%
                    gave it a 4 or 5 out
                    of 5!</b> This gave us more confidence to
                gradutally launched the beta version to more and more clients, while kept iterating on the product based
                on the
                feedback.
            </p>

            <p>To ensure a smooth transition,
                We also included a link to go back to the old reporting system, in case users find anything missing
                (some features in the old system were still not implemented in the new one) or they are simply more fond
                of the older
                version. However,
                we observed that the amount of customers switching to using the new system is increasing - and that's
                certainly a positive
                sign of the transition. </p>
