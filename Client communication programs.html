        <h4>Intro</h4>
        <p>In a research I helped conducted in Q3 2020, customers of Animana have reported that <b>client communication
                is
                seen as the top one important non-clinical task</b>. While client communication is broad and serves
            multiple
            purposes in different parts of the practice workflow, this is an important insight for us - it shows that
            while our customers want to engage as much as possible with their clients, they also care a lot about the
            experience of their clients in that communication. This insight has largely changed my perspective - <b>to
                help
                partner practices achieve their success, we should definitely think about the end users experience</b>.
        </p>


        <h4>Methodology</h4>

        </div>

        <h4>Product keywords</h4>
        <p> Web application (SAAS)</p>

        <h4>Team</h4>
        <p> 1 product manager, 1 designer (me), development team</p>

        <h4>Context & problem</h4>
        <p>One challenge that many veterinary practices are facing, is that their clients are not meeting the
            compliance, e.g. screening tests, follow up checks, treatment plan etc. This leads to revenue loss for the
            clinics and less good treatment results for the patients. </p>

        <p>To help improve client compliance, IDEXX would
            like to introduce communication programmes for practices to
            reach out to their clients, aiming to educate clients about benefits of routine and preventive care.
            Examples of such programmes are dental care, obesity issues, general wellness check etc. As the UX designer
            on the team, I am responsible for designing a new section in the existing communication tool that enables
            this new feature.
        </p>



        <h4>Process</h4>
        <div class="process">
            <h4>Evaluation of current IA</h4>

            <p>Before I join the team, some explorations around information architecture have been done by the previous
                designer. The first thing
                I did was to browse through all these explorations. The current proposal suggests an "All to individual"
                approach and propses a rather flat strucutre for the programs contents. Although this approach
                simplifies the
                hierachy, it has a shortcoming - <b>due to the fact that all the program contents are laid out on a
                    single
                    page, user will need to rely on heavy scrolling to navigate to each section.</b> During the user
                research
                sessions later, we learned that differnt sections have different priorities for users, depends on where
                users are in their journey. E.g. before launching a program, it's important to check the "preview"
                section.
                After launching a
                program, however, "Performance" will become the more frequencly visisted section.
            </p>

            <p>
                Based on this finding, I adjusted the current IA to support easy naviagtion between different sections.
            </p>

                class="img-fluid" width="1200">

            <p>
                Further, I also introduced a state flow to control & visualise the status of a program e.g. draft,
                launched, stopped, completed etc. with the intention to provide users with the visibility of the
                program status so it's clear to them whether a program is running, is stopped, is completed etc.
            </p>

            <h4>Prototyping & User testing</h4>

            <p>
                The new IA and state control aims to provide more clarity to users and support them with
                completing the most important tasks around programs. However, this is our
                good wish - <b>How do we know if it indeed makes things more clear and efficient for the users? How do
                    we
                    know they will not get overwhelmed with the addtional information?</b>
                After talking to the product maganer, we decided to run a few user testing sessions to answer these
                questions. </p>

            <p>
                I created a clickable prototype that simulates the whole life cycle of exploring-setting
                up-launching-reviewing a program, prepared an interview script and results template. We reached out to a
                few customers - they are either the owner or office manager of their veterinary practices who are often
                actively enegaged in client communication actitivites. We had a short interview with each of them first
                to understand how client communication is done at their practices. We tested the prototype by asking
                them to try using our solution and complete a few core tasks.
            </p>

            <p>Results of the testing sessions suggested, <b>the new information structure is very clear to users and
                    helped
                    them with navigating through different sections.</b> However, we also need to consider the
                experience
                of <b>"1st
                    time encounter"</b> and provide instructions on the steps for users to complete their tasks. </p>

            </div>

            <h4>Detail Journey & flow mapping</h4>
            <p> Based on the insights from the testing sessions, I mapped out the high-level user journey and
                constructed the detailed workflows for different type of programs for different use cases. I discussed
                the flow charts with the team, and made adjustments based on the feedback from product manager and
                engineers.
            </p>

            <h4>Responsive UI design</h4>
            <p> Supporting mobile experience is one of the guiding product principles. To make the programs application
                fully responsive, I used a <b>"mobile first"</b> approach to determine the overall UI and responsive
                behaviour. Breakpoints were introduced at component level to support the needs of various contents.
            </p>

            <p>During the implementation, I work together with the developers to further refine the UI and behaviours,
                and review it on different screensizes. </p>
