        <h4>Intro</h4>
        <p>In 2019, the UX Design team (UXD) at Studyportals did a series evaluation for the core page of
            Masterportals.com -
            studypage. The evaluation results showed that the current page design has a few problems: text heavy, patchy
            interface, lacing visual hierachy...these problems together created a less optimal user experience and is
            potentially the reason
            for a low conversion rate. To address these issues, UXD initaited a re-design for the current
            studypage. This project involved the entire design team, a few product managers and srum
            teams.

        <h4>Product keywords</h4>

        <h4>Team</h4>
        <p> 5 designers, 3 product managers, development team</p>

        <h4>Context & problem</h4>
        <p> As part of the redesign project, I was responsible for redesigning a specific section on
            the study page - the "Admission requirements" tab. This tab contains information about requirements a
            student needs to meet to be accepted to this programme. This is how this section currently looks on desktop
            and mobile device: </p>

        <div>
            <img src="Images/Studypage/old design.webp" alt="old design" class="img-fluid" width="1200">
        </div>
        <p>I did an evaluation of the page content which helped identify the following issues:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using tabs for different types of tests makes information less straight-forward;</li>
            <li>The graph used for displaying scores looks confusing (what is the meaning of the red colored area
                exactly?) and even breaking in certain scenarios</li>
            <li>There's no visual hierarchy - so much content! Where should I look?</li>
            <li>CTA gets buried in all the content thus doesn't stand out</li>
            <li>Visually not very appealing</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When the problems get framed, the design solutions seem to appear by themselves, starting from answer these
            questions:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>How can we make information clear and straight-forward for our users?</li>
            <li>How to introduce a clear hierarchy to contents and actions, thus better inform and guide users?</li>
            <li>How to provide good user experience for both desktop and mobile?</li>
            <li>How can we make it more visually appealing?</li>
        </ul>






        <h4>Process</h4>
        <div class="process">
            <h4>Understand the content</h4>

            <p>With these questions in mind, I started a research on the current content. These contents were inserted
                by data team or universities via an internal content management system, it contains:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>English level requirement (for international students mainly, usually proven with scores from a
                    well-know test such as IELTS or TOEFL)</li>
                <li>Academic requirement (can be proven with a GPA score, however for certain disciplines such as
                    business-related programmes, GMAT or GRE might also be required)
                </li>
                <li>Other requirement (work experience, technology requirements, and other general requirements)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Cool! That sounds not too difficult, does it? However, further investigation starts revealing the
                complexity:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We have 4 different types of English tests, some we have partnership with, some we don't.</li>
                <li>We have 3 different types of academic tests, some we have partnership with, some we don't.
                </li>
                <li>English tests are alternatives to each other, the other tests aren't.
                </li>
                <li>GPA has 2 scores specified (required vs recommended), GRE has 3 scores specified per subject, either
                    required or recommended, GMAT doesn't have a recommended score, however an "average" score.</li>
                <li>Some tests have additional information specified, some don't.</li>
                <li>Some tests specified if they are required, some don't.</li>
                <li>...</li>
            </ul>


            <h4>Define the content struture</h4>
            <p>
                While writing down all my findings, and looking at the data & specific partnership requirements I
                received from product team, I started to feel this story might be more complex than it looks....however
                I believe with the right approach, you will eventually find a solution.
            </p>
            <p>After looking into the data, I remapped the structure of the content based on its priority. Also, I
                decided to get rid of the tabs and display all the test information directly in a more structured way.
                The confusing graphs were replaced with more structured score modules.</p>
            <p>The score modules are the most important elements in the new design. They should be flexible enough to
                deal with all different score and partnership scenarios. Also, responsive behaviour should be taken into
                consideration for a consistent cross-device experience.

                I defined the following structure for the score modules:</p>
            <img src="Images/Studypage/Content structure.webp" alt="old design" class="img-fluid" width="1200">
            <p>I tested the score modules thoroughly with different scenarios, making sure they would work in any of the
                situations.</p>


            <h4>Visual & UI design</h4>
            <p>With the redesign direction in mind, I started exploring visual directions for this section. It should
                look clean, structured, visually appealing, while staying consistent with other newly redesigned
                sections. After some discussions with the visual designer on the team, I went for the following
                direction:</p>

            <img src="Images/Studypage/UI design.webp" alt="old design" class="img-fluid" width="800">

            <h4>Design evaluation</h4>
            <p>After launching, we leanred that the new design appeared to be more clear and effective than the old
                design. Users were
                able to find the information they need much more quickly, and the interactions with the CTAs improved as
                a result.</p>
