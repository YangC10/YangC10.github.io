        <h4>Intro</h4>
        <p>Year 2019 I was working on a project that has a focus on digital innovation within my organisation
            (Studyportals).
            Reflecting on the whole process, there were a lot of interesting/challenging aspects, from which I learned
            and grew a lot as a designer.


        <h4>Methodology</h4>
        <div class="icongroup">
            <img src="Images/Icons/research.svg" alt="research">
            <img src="Images/Icons/brainstorming.svg" alt="research">
            <img src="images/Icons/prototyping.svg" alt="">
            <img src="images/Icons/user testing.svg" alt="">
            <img src="images/Icons/ui.svg" alt="">
        </div>

        <h4>Product keywords</h4>
        <p> Web application</p>

        <h4>Team</h4>
        <p> 1 product manager, 1 designer (me), development team</p>

        <h4>Context & problem</h4>
        <p>Studyportals would like to focus more on its new business model: <b>enrolment based partnership (EBP)</b> in
            the
            upcoming years, since it has the potential of becoming the main revenue driver of the company. For this
            purpose, the company has started a series of innovative projects ("E-innovations"), aiming to set up a new
            business process and put a proper workflow in place for both its clients and internal users who are heavily
            involved in these processes.</p>

        <p>
            While the business has quickly analysed its current needs and developed a workflow in place for the current
            working round, this workflow has a few (crucial) flaws:
        </p>


        <ul>
            <b>
                <li>Not sustainable (difficult to handle the flexibility of the products);</li>
                <li>Not scalable (difficult to handle large amount of data in the upcoming rounds);</li>
                <li>Not auditable (cannot track who did what);</li>
            </b>
        </ul>

        <p>Also, due to the use of a tool chain (a combination of CRM, AirTable, excel files, emails, temporary landing
            pages..), a lot of unnecessary limitations and extra complexity were introduced in the workflow. Internal
            users need to switch between multiple systems to complete simple tasks; From clients’ perspective, it also
            appears to be <b>less efficient and professional</b>.

        </p>



        <p>So here comes the mission:
            As one of the "E-innovation" projects, the scrum team I was working on was responsible for building a robust
            product which will be supporting the new business process and workflow, providing efficiency & trust to both
            the internal and client users. The product should be sustainable, scalable and auditable. Since it should be
            in place already to support the next working round (starting in September 2019), the project thus had a hard
            deadline and we got about 7 months to deliver a working MVP.
        </p>


        <h4>Process</h4>
        <div class="process">
            <h4>Design thinking & service blue print</h4>

            <p>After a few kick-off meetings with important stakeholders, the team started to get more familiar with the
                new domain and the major problems that needed to be addressed. However, there was so much information
                and everything sounded so complicated...How do we get started with developing a product?



                As the UX designer on the team, I encouraged the team to take the “Design Thinking” approach. We
                followed the following process to approach buildinging the solution.

            </p>

            <img src="images/BusinessInnovation/design thinking.webp" alt="design thinking" class="img-fluid"
                width="600">

            <p>We conducted a series research activities to understand internal users' current experience. Insights from
                these activities gave us a clear view on
                the major problems they are experiencing today and where improvements should happen. I started to map
                out a service blueprint
                which illustrates these information: different user roles, their main tasks & flows, current tools,
                challenges, and
                services that should be in place to support their work. While doing this, the whole picture started to
                become more and more clear.</p>
            <p>
                Below is a simplified version of the service blueprint on the white board for team to get a good grasp.
            </p>

                width="1200">

            <h4>Wireframing initial ideas</h4>

            <p>We brainstormed as a whole team on ideas and possible solutions. Based on the ideas that emerging during
                the discussions, I created a series of wireframes to visualise the concept of the products. These
                wireframes helped me capture the needs of the business and users, and it allowed me to explore already a
                bit on how the products might look/work.</p>
            <p>
                After examining the whole concept with PO and stakeholders and testing with users with prototypes, the
                concept of the product was further consolidated. We started writing user stories, mapping out big
                milestones on the timeline, and planning our sprints based on them.</p>

            <img src="images/BusinessInnovation/initial wireframes.webp" alt="initial wireframes" class="img-fluid"
                width="1200">


            <h4>Duel track design & development</h4>
            <p>Product design and development is an iterative process. Business process keeps changing, new requests
                keep coming, user feedback keeps coming from the user tests. As a result, we constantly adjust our
                workflow/concepts to integrate these input into our design and development work. Every sprint we
                gathered
                together with our stakeholders to review the
                deliverables, planed upcoming stories in the backlogs and sprint plannings, reflected on our progress
                during retrospectives.</p>
            <p>

                In a retrospective, we felt we could do a better job in leading the definition of our products. Due to
                the deadline and the nature of the products (heavily focusing on business's needs), we were relying too
                much on stakeholders' input and defining stories around it. Very often these input came as suggested
                solutions (e.g. new features), however the underlying user needs weren't always further investigated.
                However, talking to users and observing how they work really helped - later we learned to challenge
                these requests and re-define the problems by figuring out the actual user needs and writing better user
                stories.</p>


            <h4>Use design system to ensure consistency and reusability</h4>
            <p>While working on the product design, I realised the patterns in the products can get rather complicated.
                Since we have limited time, I wanted to find a way to design fast yet ensure the design's quality and
                consistency. I took a Design System approach (I am a big fan of Design System) to componentize the
                design elements. Through this way I can ensure as much as possible the consistency of the design within
                the products, as well as improve the efficiency of my design process.</p>

            <p>Below is a screen shot of some of the symbols I created in my design file, since our product contains
                highly complex components (e.g. tables), working with symbols makes modifying designs and checking
                different scenarios much faster and easier.</p>

                width="1200">


            <h4>Deliver</h4>
            <p>7 months have passed, we have successfully delivered our MVP. It consists of two products: an internal
                system where data gets processed initially by internal users, and a client platform where our clients
                can further review and confirm the results. When the first client-processed results coming into the
                system, we felt great excitement! It has been great commitment and efforts from everyone, and working
                together intensively has certainly strengthened us as a team.
            </p>
            <p>(And, we got thank-you cup cakes from our stakeholders)</p>
