        <h4>Intro</h4>
        <p>TVP is an app that aims to help people fight against addictions, it is inspired and informed by a scientific
            methodology that has been performed in the the clinics to prevent the relapse of certain addictions e.g.
            alcohol, gambling. I
            worked together
            with two other friends on TVP as a side project in 2020.

        <h4>Team</h4>
        <p> 2 developers, 1 designer (me)</p>

        <h4>Context & problem</h4>
        <p> The relapse prevention menthod(Dutch name "terugvalpreventiemethoden") is used in some Dutch clinics to help
            patients who have addiction problems. The methods leverages a series of self-intervention methods including
            documenting the "risk situtaions" where they are likely to relapse to their addiction problems and providing
            corresponding interventions during these situations. While this method traditionally uses diary, notes, and
            other paper-format
            documents, it made us think if we can take advantage of the digital tools to make this method even more
            accessible and usable. Compared to
            the traditional way, a digital tool has the following advantages: </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Keep all the records at one place;</li>
            <li>Easy to access with a digital device for "in the moment"</li>
            <li>Easy to customise for differnt individuals unique situation</li>
            <li>No need for massive paper printing & easy to update & maintain</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We thought it would be interesting to turn this method into a mobile app and take advantage of the above
            to help patients with dealing difficult relapse situations. </p>

        <p>As the UX designer on the team, I was responsive
            for the overall design of the app.</p>




        <h4>Process</h4>
        <div class="process">
            <h4>Concept and user flow</h4>

            <p>We had a series of discussions within the 3 of us to develop the concept of the app. The concept
                incorprates a few core definiations and interventions of the "TVP" methods. Based on these concepts, we
                scoped the functions for the first version of the app and I
                created the information architecutre and user flows that represents the entire interaction between a
                user and the app.</p>
            <img src="images/TVP/Userflow.png" alt="concept and user flow" class="img-fluid" width="800">

            <h4>Branding exploration</h4>
            <p>
                I defined the direction for the app's branding and visual direction, which can be summarised as
                following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Friendly & supportive (we are here to help)</li>
                <li>Optimism (fighting addiction is difficult. but it doesn't have to be a heavy topic)</li>
                <li>Easy and quick (easy actions can help you faster)</li>
                <li>Good-looking (it should bring some delight to your eyes)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I thought of using a character - a polar bear - as the "mascot" in the app. He shares some similarities
                with users themselves, who lives in an isolated and difficult environment or situation, yet stays tough
                and strong-minded. (still to be validated if this is a really good idea - according to my Dutch friend,
                in the Netherlands people sometimes can be reluctant towards a fully positive character and find it too
                superficial. I find it an interesting insight how culture can influence people's perspective.)

            <h4>UI Design</h4>
            <p>Whilte developing the UIs, I created reusable symbols to help capture the UI patterns I use consistenly
                for different context. Based on the brand styles and these UI components, I created a mini design system
                to document the core elements
                in the brand and
                help me to further improve the consistency
                UI accross the entire app. </p>
