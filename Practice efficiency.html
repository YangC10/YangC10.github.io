        <h4>Intro</h4>
        <p>Animana is a "PIMS" (Practice Information Management System) used by most veterinary
            practices in the Netherlands. It's the backbone of a practice, quietly supporting different staff
            with the most important day-to-day
            tasks, from patient
            information management to appointment booking, from test ordering to imaging requesting, from stock
            management to accounting...after spending a lot of time understanding how the system is being used by our
            customers,
            I have realised that <b>improving efficiency is the key in delivering the best user experience and building
                successful solutions.</b> Working closely with product managers, I use data to discover problems and
            include
            customers in our process to understand their pain points, brainstorm together and test our solutions.
        </p>

        <h4>Customer-centered approach</h4>
        <p>Through my career, I have learned to differentiate <b>"needs"</b> from <b>"requests"</b>. Real needs can be
            hard to identify, it requires one to go beyond the requests (which are usually very tempting to follow) and
            dig further and deeper. However, needs are the most important part - a thorough understanding of the user
            needs is the key to finding a winning solution.
        </p>

        <p>
            To constantly improve our solution so that it helps our customers with their most impressing needs, it's
            crucial to bring customer insights into the solution development process. I do so via 2 ways: 1) <b>leverage
                data and analytics;</b> 2) <b>working together with customers</b>. Through data and analytics, I
            discover problems that might get missed; Through observations, interviews and prototype testings, I include
            customers at early stages of the solution design, which helps the team gain a deep understanding of the
            problems and test our ideas early.
        </p>

            <span class="label">UI design</span>
        </div>

        <h4>Team</h4>
        <p> 1 product manager, 1 designer (me), development team</p>

        <h4>Context & problem</h4>
        <p>Invoice is one of the most used functional area in Animana. Mid-2019, Animana launched a new crediting
            invoice functionality to part of the customers to provide them with a more rubust way of dealing with
            returned
            items. Beginning of 2020, customers (mainly livestock customers) have reported slow performance of the
            invoice crediting function - for large invoice that has 200+ items, it
            can take <b>30min</b> to perform one single action and <b>2 hours</b> for crediting the entire invoice!
        </p>


        <h4>Process</h4>
        <div class="process">
            <h4>Rapid research</h4>

            <p>After a quick examination of this functionality with the developers, I came to
                the conclusion that an important contributor of the poor performance is the current interaction
                behaviour - selecting
                all items by default and triggering validation on every single change made on the invoice lines. For a
                long invoice with hunderds of items, this can cause the system to behave very slow. As the system does
                not indicate to users that it's busy, users very often thought it's getting stuck or frozen thus gave up
                on waiting.
            </p>
            <p>Digging into the cases logged by customer support however reveals bigger, and more severe problems -
                since the launch of this functionality, it has triggered over <b>1000</b> support cases in the first 4
                months,
                with customers asking primarily one question: <b>"How does this work??"</b>
            </p>

            <img src="Images/Practice efficiency/credit analysis.png" alt="credit invoice analysis" class="img-fluid"
                width="600">

            <p>I realize, this functionaliy has serious learnability/usability issues that the team was not aware of -
                customer support did a great job explaining how this function works thus it was never logged as a
                "request" to be solved.
                Given that Animana is planning to
                release this functionality to the remaining users in the near future, to prevent the same situation from
                happening, I
                proposed to the product manager to address the usability issues before next launch. </b>
            </p>

            <h4>Scope definition</h4>

            <p>
                To provide clarity on the scope of this work, we have planned the following:
            </p>

            <p>
                Immediate value - improve performance by improving interaction design<br>
                Long term value - address usability/learnability issues to reduce friction in onboarding and
                daily use.
            </p>



            <h4>Solution design & testing</h4>
            <p>I adjusted the interacton design so that users land on the page with no items selected by default. We
                will provide a new "select all" function to support quickly selecting all items. Validation will be
                triggered only opon the activation of field of a selected item. Also, the system will provide visual
                indicator to the users while it's processing. Performance test result shows, for the same invoice,
                the
                interaction
                change has effectively reduced the processing time from 2+ hours to ~15min.
            </p>

            <p>I also conducted a heuristics evaluation for the entire crediting workflow, and worked closely with
                colleagues from customer support to
                map out the major usability pain points. Results from these
                activities were later translated into a series of improvment points and design adjustments.</p>

            <img src="Images/Practice efficiency/credit invoice workflow.png" alt="credit invoice workflow painpoints"
                class="img-fluid" width="1200">

            <p>Based on these insights, I created an clickable prototype that illustrate the new experience and
                scheduled testing sessions with a few customers. We would like to know, <b>how would customers
                    receive
                    these chanages
                    (historically, we learned that our busy customers are often not fond of changes)? How do
                    they feel about the performance improvement?</b></p>

            <img src="Images/Practice efficiency/credit interview.png" alt="credit invoice workflow painpoints"
                class="img-fluid" width="800">


            <h4>Evaluation</h4>

            <P> Observation from customer
                interviews told us, the new workflow appeared to be <b>much more natural</b> for users and they felt
                <b>they
                    could
                    complete the task faster and easier without making uncessary clicks and mistakes</b>. As for the
                processing
                time, 15min is still not
                ideal (perfectly understandbale, it's still a long waiting time!) however, due to the fact that the
                system is clearly indicating
                its status, users felt that they know what to expect thus it became less of an issue, compared to
                before(uncertain & panic).
            </P>

            <P>These insights gave the team a lot of confidence to move forward with the current solution. We first
                launched the performance improvement and soon got positive feedback from customers who have been
                suffering from long waiting time. We also planned usability enhancement to be before lauching this
                functionality to the remaining customers.</P>

        <h4>Team</h4>
        <p> 1 product manager, 1 designer (me)</p>

        <h4>Context & problem</h4>
        <p>Q2 2020, when looking through a recently conducted research, the product management team noticed that the
            users in UK practices have been talking about the adminitrative-related functions/moules in a consistent way
            -
            that
            they are inefficient and cumbersome thus making their life difficult. The team has realized, although
            through the years they have already learned a great deal about some of the "obvious" user roles e.g.
            vet,
            receptionist, practice manager etc., they are lacking deep knowledge about a somewhat "mysterous" role -
            <b>administrators</b>. Who are they? What do their workflows look like? What are the problems they
            experience
            today
            and how can we help them solve it?
        </p>

        <p>
            With these questions in mind, I teamed up with a product manager, together, we decided to conduct a
            research
            to get a good understanding around administrative work in UK practices and workflows of associated
            users.
        </p>

        <h4>Process</h4>
        <div class="process">
            <h4>Information collection</h4>
            <p>We started by collecting information that we have easy access to. There are some great internal sources
                for us to go to: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Internal stakeholders (e.g. UK customer success & support team)</li>
                <li>Logged support cases/requests</li>
                <li>Helpdesk tickets</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After spending some time interviewing internal stakeholders, going through all the logged cases &
                tickets, we had
                mapped out our preliminary list of administrative tasks that are current being conducted at the
                practices. It's a long list (and possibly not complete): </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Paper work (form scanning & printing)</li>
                <li>Client/patient registration</li>
                <li>Patient history sharing</li>
                <li>Client communication</li>
                <li>Staff scheduling</li>
                <li>Health plan management</li>
                <li>debt management</li>
                <li>Insurance management</li>
                <li>Stock management</li>
                <li>Internal communication</li>
                <li>...</li>

            </ul>

            <p>Looking at the list, we asked ourselves: how do customers define what an "administrative task" is? Who
                are
                doing these tasks? Which are the most important ones and how are they related to their success? To
                answer these questions, we also interviewed some customers and sent out a survey to the rest.</p>

            <h4>Initial analysis</h4>
            <p>Going through all the insights we have collected so far, we have some important findings which shed some
                light on our research questions. Some of these findings include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Administrative work has a broad range of tasks. They vary in size and complexity, very often
                    intertwine with one another. One customer describes it as "I consider everything non-clinical
                    administrative tasks".</li>
                <li>The mysterous "Administrator" role can be dynamic - who's conducting what type of admin tasks
                    can vary from practice to practice and largely depends on the practice size;</li>
                <li>Admin work impacts the success of a practice via multiple aspects, such as revenue, cost/efficiency,
                    legal and client experience.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These findings largely challenged our previous assumptions where we tend to think admin tasks are clearly
                defined and are independent from each other. Most importantly, the role of an "Administrator" can be
                anyone!
                It all depends on the size of the clinic and how staff operate internally. In the presentation later, I
                used
                these two slides to show how our thinkings changed before & after:
            </p>
            <div class="imggroup">
                <img src="Images/Admin research/Admin-before.png" alt="admin research before" class="img-fluid"
                    width="540">
                <img src="Images/Admin research/Admin-after.png" alt="admin research before" class="img-fluid"
                    width="540">

            </div>

            <h4>Further analysis and mapping</h4>
            <p>We mapped out the dynamics of the admin roles at practices and their responsibilities using existing
                established personas. We also conducted gap analysis of each of the identified administrative
                task/area by examining the current workflows and user experience. We then connect them back to the
                helpdesk tickets/customer requests. During this process, we started to see some interesting pattens.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>We noticed, the functions/modules that users experience the most pain points, are not
                        designed
                        with users' entire workflow in mind. Thus they fail to support users' goals in a
                        holistic way
                        and very often demand more mannual work from users themselves.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>When summarizing the identified pain points, some keywords have been constantly showing
                        up
                        accross all the areas (with different weights and priorities). They are: <b>efficiency
                            (almost
                            always on the top), clarity, accuracy, relevancy, findability, flexibility, and
                            traceability.</b> These keywords, later formed the base of the product design
                        principles.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>



            <h4>Results sharing</h4>
            <p>We were very excited with our findings and wanted to share this with other team members and
                stakeholders. We decided that writing a report would be a good way to scructure all our messy notes
                in the excel files into something easier to read and understand. As a result, we
                completed a 36-page report which captures the most important insights that we want to share with the
                rest.</p>
            <p>In addition to the report, We have also delivered a presentaion to the whole product team and
                stakeholders, where we shared our
                research process & findings and encourage the team to reach out to us with their questions,
                comments and other initiatives.</p>

            <h4>Use insights to drive product development</h4>
            <p>One of the most important goals of this research, is to find a way to translate these findings into plan
                and actions. We discussed the results with the product management team and identified quick-wins that
                deliver immediate value with relatively low efforts, as well as bigger projects that require long-term
                efforts and multiple
                iterations. We updated our roadmap to reflect these findings. </p>

            <p>Also, based on the insights and keywords we identified earlier, we started
                to form some design principles that team should be keeping in mind during solution building. They can be
                summaried into two major points: 1) Support users by supporting their entire workflow, rather than
                focusing on inidivual task. Keep the keywords in mind (efficiency, clarity, etc.) and challenge the
                proposed soluions by asking how it can fail to support users by failing to consider these keywords.

        <h4>Team</h4>
        <p> 1 product manager, 1 designer (me), development team</p>

        <h4>Context & problem</h4>
        <p>To ensure that UK customers are compliant with UK’s “Making Tax Digital” legislation, Animana is seeking to
            integrate with an accounting software: Sage Business Cloud Accounting. During the research phase, we
            realised that to ensure the integration is successful, manual data mapping conducted by users
            between the two systems is unfortunately necessary - such mappings include: contacts, nominal accounts, VAT
            etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            This was my first time working with accounting software, it didn't take long for
            me to find out that this is a rather complicated domain, all the difficult terms and complex processes
            constantly dragged me into deep rabbit holes. Soon, the product manager and I had
            reached a conclusion: for users who don't have knowledge in finance and accounting, this can be a
            very difficult process (and possible cause disaster consequences!). <b>How do we make sure we can support
                our
                users with this manual mapping process, so that they can smoothly complete the task and make as least
                mistakes as possible?</b>
            But to answer this question, there is another question that needs to be answered first: <b>who will likely
                be
                doing this mapping process?</b>
        </p>

        <h4>Process</h4>
        <div class="process">
            <h4>Understand current experience</h4>
            <p>To answer these questions, we have reached out to our customers to ask them to explain to us how
                accounting (especially tax return) is done at their practices. Two relevant roles emerged from these
                conversations - <b>the
                    practice manager</b> and <b>the accountant</b>. Depends on the size of the practice and the amount
                of
                accounting
                work that needs to be done, it can either be that one of the roles picks up accounting work completely,
                or they collaborate together on this task. While studying the two different personas, we learned that
                compared to an accountant (a professional in accounting, often working with multiple clients), a
                practice managers' knowledge about accounting is not necessarily more than us(unless this is a extremely
                small clinic where manager does all the accounting work)! </p>

            <h4>Solution design & testing</h4>
            <p>
                This means the design of the mapping experience needs to cater for this fact. Therefore, I defined a
                design strategy which focuses on delivering a guiding & educating experience. It can be summarised as
                the following:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Provide sufficient help!</li>
                <li>Keep users informed about their actions (pre-conditions, what’s happening, consequences)</li>
                <li>Apply validations when possible (user permissions, error prevention)</li>
                <li>Support easy continuation from interupted workflow - e.g. autosave progress</li>
                <li>Provide confimation for important steps e.g. sync</li>
                <li>Reusable & consistent solution for future integrations</li>
            </ul>

            <img src="Images/Sage/Flow.png" alt=" admin research before" class="img-fluid" width="1200">

            <p>These principles were later translated into product & design decisions, such as: break things down into
                digestable steps, explain terms & jargons, leverage validations and notifications, auto-save progress,
                include helpful materials, tips and articles.</p>
            <p>I made a clickable prototype simulating the entire mapping experience and validated it via testing with
                customers (they are a combination of practice managers and accountants). We have received very positive
                results - all
                the customers who participated in the testing mentioned that they feel this is a very easy process.
                Practice manager useres felt that they have got a lot of support during this seemly difficult process
                thus are
                comfortable in performing this task themselves.
                Accountant users, on the other hand, mentioned that everything they saw make sense to them from
                accounting perspectice and
                felt it was a very easy process.</p>

            <p>This gave us the confidence to continue
                using this approach to build our solutions.</p>
