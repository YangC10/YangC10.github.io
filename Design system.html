        <h4>Intro</h4>
        <p>I have been a fan of Design Systems - while working on differnt type of projects or products, I have always
            ineivitably found myself working with some form of Design System - small or large, simple or complex. The
            idea behind a Design System has impacted my
            design process so much that I can't imagine myself working without it anymore. For people who are less
            familiar with a Design System, it's a "pattern library" and seems only designers are benefiting from it;
            However
            its
            benefits are much more than that. In my eyes, there are at least 3 great things about Design Systems:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Maintain brand consistency accross products;</li>
            <li>Ensure consistency of the user experience;</li>
            <li>Improve design & development efficiency via reusability</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I have always become part of the "Design System Team" in a design team, working on different
            aspects of a
            design system. Through colloboration with other designers and developers, we constantly improve the design
            system
            to make it work better for the designers and developers, and eventually, for the products and users it's
            serving. </p>


        <h2>Case Studies</h2>

        <h3>1. Set up Studyportals' Design System</h3>
        <div class="labelgroup">
            <span class="label">Component audit & documentation</span>
            <span class="label">Styleguide design</span>
            <span class="label">UI library</span>
        </div>

        <h4>Team</h4>
        <p> 2 designers</p>

        <h4>Context & problem</h4>
        <p> As the design team is growing in size, Studyportals would like to set up a styleguide that helps to maintain
            the design consistency accross different sections of its products. I volunteerd with another designer on the
            team to work on this project. The established website can be viewed at <a
                href="https://styleguide.studyportals.com/">
                <b>styleguide.studyportals.com</b></a>.
        </p>

        <h4>Process</h4>
        <div class="process">
            <h4>Components audit & definition</h4>

            <p>With the help from the design team, We conducted an audit to understand the current usage of the
                "components" - which have been
                used (somewhat) consistently accross the platform? Which ones are messy and need to be re-defined?</p>

            <p>Based on the results of the audit, we started to create documentation for different components, defining
                it's style and behaviour. We went through a few design discussions with all the designers on the team
                to look at these guidelines and iterate based on their feedback.</p>
            <p>Below is an exmpale for the button component:</p>
            <img src="Images/DS/Audit.png" alt="Button audit" class="img-fluid" width="1200">


            <h4>Styleguide website design</h4>
            <p>We decided to create a single source of truth for the documentation of the components - one that we can
                easily
                update & maintain, and easy to access for everyone (e.g. designers, product managers, developers,
                marketing etc.).
                A website seems to be a good option for such purpose.
                After going through many other syleguide websites and discussing about our own needs, we started to
                create a series of wireframes to capture the ideal style direction and content structure.</p>

            <img src="Images/DS/Wireframe.png" alt="Website wireframe" class="img-fluid" width="1200">

            <h4>Sketch library</h4>
            <p>We dreamed of creating a "holy grail" design system, where design library, styleguide and code library
                all match each other. We started with building the link between the styleguide and design library first
                by creating reusable symbols in Sketch. This way designers can have a easy toolkit to use during the
                design process. This is a collaborative work from several designers on the team.
            </p>

            <p>Below is a subset of the design system, a smaller set of symbols created for Studyportals' client-facing
                products.</p>
            <img src="Images/DS/Symbols.png" alt="Reusable symbols" class="img-fluid" width="1200">

            <h4>Maintain & update</h4>
            <p>We understand design system is <b>a living system</b>, the only way to make sure that it best serves the
                products is to make sure it's constantly being maintained and updated. We developed a process to
                regularly communicate to the product teams around the progress of component development, as well as
                hearing from the teams about the needs for new components.</p>
            <p>
                We also developed a few tools and templates for designers to request updates and create components
                themselves
                (e.g. icons). We designed components and get feedback from designers and developers. We also send out
                updates to the whole company on the recent additions and changes to the styleguide.</p>

            <p>The process was working very well - we have created an engaging process where design system is
                becoming a crucial part of the product development process.</p>

        <h3>2. Contribute to IDEXX'SPOT Design System</h3>
        <div class="labelgroup">
            <span class="label">Component design</span>
            <span class="label">UI library</span>
            <span class="label">Library migration</span>
        </div>

        <h4>Team</h4>
        <p> 4 designers, 1 developer</p>

        <h4>Context</h4>
        <p> SPOT is IDEXX's Design system, it's a medium-large sized system which contained more than 20 different
            components. All the components presented in the system have their design symbols created in the Sketch
            library and their code equivalence. A team of 5 (4 designers and 1 developer) are actively working on
            maintaining & updateing the system, making sure new components are being designed and developed that suit
            the design team's needs. </p>
        <p>

            As a member on the team, I am responsible for components creation, documentation
            and library
            update. A
            recent example that I worked on is the badge component.
        </p>

        <h4>Process</h4>
        <div class="process">
            <h4>Design review & feedback session</h4>
            <p>Badge component can be used to provide additional information on another component, the red notification
                bubble that's common to see in modern products is an example of a badge. The design team has been
                consistenly reporting the
                need for such a component. One designer on the team made the initial design some time ago, and I picked
                up the work from there and continued with reviewing and refining the current proposal.</p>

            <p>I hosted a few workshops with the whole design team to go through current usage and needs for the badge
                component in various products accross the company. From there we examined from differnt aspects whether
                the current proposal
                could work in
                different contexts and made adjustments and additions. </p>
            <p>
                During these sessions, there has been some confusion from the team around the difference between badge
                and another
                component: Pills. We also
                did a comparison to further make the distinction
                between the
                two and clarity the use cases for each.</p>

            <img src="Images/DS/discussion session.png" alt="Feedback session" class="img-fluid" width="1200">

            <h4>Documentation & component creation</h4>
            <p>Based on the input from these discussions, I finalized the design proposal and made a detailed
                documentation of the badge component, describing it's styles, behaviour, variants and usage guidelines.
                I worked together with the
                developer on the team to create badge component both in the Sketch library and in the code base. </p>
            <p>
                We
                tested the different variants and use cases thoroughly ourselves, before publishing it.</p>

            <h4>Usage & monitoring</h4>
            <p>We published the badge component on the SPOT website, together with the design symbols and code
                equivalence. We encouraged the team to start using the new
                badge
                component. Through design discussions, we observe the usage of it and identify how it can be
                improved to make it easier for people to use via e.g. naming convention, color variants improvements.
