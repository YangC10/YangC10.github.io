        <h4>&#x1F44B; Hello there!</h4>
        <p>
            Nice to see you here! My name is Yang Chen and I am a product/UX designer based in the Netherlands.
            Originally
            from Inner Mongolia, China, I came to the Netherlands in 2013 for my Master study in Media Technology.
            Currently
            I am living in the city of
            Utrecht, together with my husband and our two cats - Mochi and Lambiek (they are the best cats ever).</p>
        <h4>&#x26F5; My journey to UX Design</h4>
        <p>I have always known that I am attracted to certain things: interactivity, technology, highly visual things,
            psychology...I decided to become a UX designer thanks to a book - <b>"The Design
                of
                Everyday Things"</b> by Don Norman.
            From this book, I learned about the power of human-centered design and started to look at the
            world from a
            completely different angle.
            This book introduced me to user experience design - and that was my "Eureka moment". I immersed myself
            into the field of UX - I took lessons, read books and articles, constantly practicing my skills and
            learning everything I could about UX design. </p>

        <h4>&#x1F43E; Work experience</h4>
        <p>I started working as a UX designer in 2016, first at Studyportals - a company based in Eindhoven, where I
            worked as a UX designer, designing for a series of SP's client-facing products and later also student-facing
            platform: Mastersportal.com.
        </p>
        <p>Later, I joined IDEXX Animana as a UX designer, responsible for all the design & research activities for
            Animana (information management system for veterinary practices). Currently, I am working remotely with
            another
            IDEXX team who's building communication tools for veterinary clinics, and at the same time helping out with
            product discovery activities for pet owner facing products. </p>


        Along the way, I had the luck of
        meeting and working with some great people
        from whom I learned a great
        deal.
        </p>

        <h4>&#x1F483; Outside of working hours</h4>
        <p>When I am not designing, I am usually reading, spending time with my cats, learning Dutch, drumming, making
            pop-up cards, playing <a
                href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fi.reworks.redecor&hl=en&gl=US">Redecor</a> (well,
            still designing!), gardening, or
            having a "weekendje
            weg" with my husband...Covid-19 has forced us to spend most of the time at home but I always find ways to
            keep myself busy!
        </p>
        <p>If you are looking for a UX designer, or need UX advice, or simply looking
            for someone to chat about UX, let's get in touch! </p>
